I made my symbol table by hashing my password. For the hashing I converted every character to a value between 1 and 42 (the number of "letters" in my alphabet). After this, I went through each index in the password string, then got the value of the character at that index and multiplied it by 42 raised to the index power. I then added all the values together and stored the time in that index in the array. To get the time I did the same process though instead of setting the value I was getting it.I used this approach because it would save more space in memory by using contiguous memory instead of allocating more every time I need to add a new node for every possible password. It also makes searching and adding more intuitive than trying to traverse nodes to get to the time.
